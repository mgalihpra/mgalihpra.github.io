<h2>Muhammad Galih Prawiradilaga</h2>
I have master degree in astrophysics from Institut Teknologi Bandung and currently serving as chairman for Pajajaran Physical Society. My recent field of study is stellar evolution, especially white dwarf accreting helium. I have some experiences related to scientific writing such as writing a paper for competition and publication. I also routinely publish physics content on the social media of Pajajaran Physical Society. I'm highly keen to learn about physics, especially in the field of education and research.

## Experience
### 2019 - now | Chairman of Pajajaran Physical Society
Pajajaran Physical Society (PPS) is a community that focuses on spreading the knowledge of physics and its benefit for the surrounding. The activities include (see project section below for detail)
- Interesting Fact Time
- Course Material
- Webinar
- Physics Explanation Challenge

### Summer 2022 | Student Researcher
I was a participant at Astrophysics Summer Program for International Research Experience (ASPIRE) held by Anton Pannekoek Institute (API), University of Amsterdam.
- <strong>Project</strong>: Finding AM CVn System from ZTF Data by Using Machine Learning
- <strong>Advisor</strong>: Dr. Jan van Roestel
  
### 2021 - now | Video solution Maker at CoLearn
As a video solution makers for physics subject
- Solving various physics problems at high school level
- Creating explanation video

## Education
### 2020 - 2022 | M.Sc. in Astronomy (minor in astrophysics), Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia
Minor in astrophysics, my research is about numerical simulation on carbon burning off-center inside carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting helium using MESA.
- Analyzing the long-term evolution of white dwarf accreting helium (its mass and luminosity)
- Analyzing the effect of overshooting on the occurrence of carbon burning off-center inside the white dwarf

### 2016 - 2020 | B.Sc. in Physics, Universitas Padjadjaran, Indonesia
My bachelor thesis is about designing a thermoelectric cloud chamber for detecting nuclear radiation
- Analyzing the proper combination of thermoelectric cooling for cloud chamber.
- Observing the tracks emitted by nuclear radiation from radioactive samples.
