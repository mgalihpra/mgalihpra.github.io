<h2>Muhammad Galih Prawiradilaga</h2>
I have master degree in astrophysics from Institut Teknologi Bandung and currently serving as chairman for Pajajaran Physical Society. My recent field of study is stellar evolution, especially white dwarf accreting helium. I have some experiences related to scientific writing such as writing a paper for competition and publication. I also routinely publish physics content on the social media of Pajajaran Physical Society. I'm highly keen to learn about physics, especially in the field of education and research.
